<h1>2. Make elements focusable from the keyboard</h1>

Use the TAB key to move through the following collection of links to understand how setting the tabindex can alter how it appears in the keyboard tab ordering sequence.

<h2>Default tabindex</h2>
<p>The below links use the default tabindex which is the same as their onscreen position.</p>

<h2>Artificially set tabindex</h2>
<p>This link has a tabindex artificially set to 1 which makes it appear as the first item in the keyboard tab sequence even though it's the second to last link.</p>

<p>This link has a tabindex artificially set to 1010 which makes it appear as the second item in the keyboard tab sequence even though it's the last link.</p>
