# Core accessibility patterns for better Joomla! sites
Accessibility is hard, we know what web accessibility is but trying to apply techniques from a difficult to understand technical document is a challenge. Where to start? Is this relevant? What does this mean? It can end up being all too hard to do. It doesn't need to be this way, focusing on just 4 core patterns will mean the accessibility of your pages and site is radically improved. You'll understand what to do on your own sites by following simple techniques with straight forward rationale, and go from accessibility zero to accessibility hero.
