# Not another checklist! â€“ A testing methodology which explains the what and how of manual accessibility testing
Accessibility testing is hard. How do you upskill team members to understand WCAG 2.1? How do you explain testing with screen readers? This is a challenge I faced with new team members and requests to standardise the testing. 

I created a checklist which made accessibility testing consistent and removed different interpretations and inaccurate assumptions. When a team's accessibility maturity is low creating a checklist with this methodology results in a testing process anyone can understand.
